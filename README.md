# Layered-Learning

A collection of explainers to break down complex topics step by step.  
Each topic is explained across multiple levels, starting from simple intuition and gradually moving toward expert-level depth.

## Explanation Levels

- Level 0 — one-sentence intuition  
- Level 1 — like you’re 5  
- Level 2 — middle school  
- Level 3 — high school  
- Level 4 — university  
- Level 5 — practitioner / implementation  
- Level 6 — expert / research  

## Structure

All explainers are stored in the `topics/` folder.  
The reusable prompt for generating new layered explanations is in `topic_prompt.md`.

## Purpose

I've found value in learning by layering explanations. 
Each topic starts with the simplest possible mental model and gradually builds up technical depth,  
helping you understand complex concepts one layer at a time.
