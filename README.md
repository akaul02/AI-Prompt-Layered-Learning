# Explain by Progressively Increasing the Complexity

This repository stores explainers for different topics.  
Each topic is explained across seven levels that build on each other:

- Level 0 — one-sentence intuition
- Level 1 — like you’re 5
- Level 2 — middle school
- Level 3 — high school
- Level 4 — university
- Level 5 — practitioner / implementation
- Level 6 — expert / research

All explainers are stored in the `topics/` folder.  
To add a new explainer, use the prompt in `topic_prompt.md`.
